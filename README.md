# React Classes Exercise: CheeZJokes App 
The app allows people view and vote on cheesy jokes. To generate jokes, it uses the external API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api). The application is written using class components.

* When the page loads, the application fetches 10 jokes, making sure that no joke appears more than once on the page.
* The list of jokes, with votes is stored in local storage. When users visit the app, it shows saved jokes. The user is able to generate new jokes via the button, and these new jokes replaces the ones in local storage.
* The application lists the jokes, along with a “vote-up” button, a “vote-down” button, and the net score (up - down) for each joke. Users can vote, and the net score updates.

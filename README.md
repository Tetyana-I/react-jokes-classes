# React Classes Exercise: CheeZJokes App 
The app allows people view and vote on cheesy jokes. To generate jokes, it uses the external API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).

When the page loads, the application fetches 10 jokes, making sure that no joke appears more than once on the page.

The application lists the jokes, along with a “vote-up” button, a “vote-down” button, and the net score (up - down) for each joke. Users can vote, and the net score updates.

The application is written using class components.
